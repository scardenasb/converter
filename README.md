## Converter

> This is a minimalist yet extensible unit converter built using [Django](https://github.com/django/django).
> The converter's logic is simplified to determine an exponent for conversions, allowing you to add new units
> to the Unit model simply by declaring the exponent and utilizing the fk to the corresponding
> Type model.

> You can find it at ğŸ‘‰ [converter]().

> TODOs: Incorporate different unit systems (si, american, etc.). 
> A good idea would be to use select2totree.
